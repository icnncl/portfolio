**Link:** [Live Demo](https://qpms.pythonanywhere.com) | [Full Details](https://github.com/icnncl/portfolio/blob/main/qpms.md)

### **Problem**  
Teams needed a simple internal system for project and task tracking without relying on expensive SaaS tools or working in environments with no internet access.

### **Scope**  
Developed full-stack features (project creation, issues, roles, dashboards).  
Designed and executed end-to-end test scenarios including:  
- CRUD validation  
- User-role workflow tests  
- Form validation  
- Error handling  
- Regression suites using PyTest and Selenium  

### **Outcome**  
Delivered a stable MVP with structured QA coverage, uncovering UI/logic defects early.  
Improved workflow clarity and demonstrated hands-on capability in:  
- designing test cases  
- executing manual tests  
- preparing automation-ready test structures  
- documenting defects

**Link:** [Live Demo](https://chantak.onrender.com) | [Full Details](https://github.com/icnncl/portfolio/blob/main/chantak.md)

### **Problem**  
Users lacked a unified way to search nutrition ingredients consistently.

### **Scope**

### **Outcome**  
Delivered a reliable ingredient lookup tool and strengthened structured testing, including bug reporting and regression testing.

## **Shineklass – Online Co-working Learning Platform**  
**Tech:** Community solution + Django, PostgreSQL  

### **Problem**  
Many self-learners lose motivation and consistency when studying alone, lacking peer support, accountability, and a structured space to work toward their career goals.

### **Scope**  
Built and tested early-stage features enabling learners to:  
- join peer groups  
- participate in online co-working sessions    

Also developing features to give learners better information about their subject areas.

### **Outcome**  
Tested community features and event sessions, validated forms and workflows, and began implementing functions designed to provide learners with more information about their learning subjects.  
Strengthened skills in structured bug reporting and regression testing during development.
